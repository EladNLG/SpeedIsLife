# Speed Is Life
A new set of difficulties that will make your campaign just a little bit harder ;)
## Changes:
Forced miss chances for fast pilots reduced to 0% on master.

Damage Scalars:
|          | Easy | Normal | Hard | Master |
|----------|------|--------|------|--------|
| Now      | 2    | 3      | 4    | 6      |
| Normally | 0.5  | 1      | 1.5  | 1.9    |

**NEW:** Damage Scalar for fast pilots:
| Easy | Normal | Hard | Master |
|------|--------|------|--------|
| 0.66 | 1      | 1.5  | 2.5    |

Fast Pilot requirement changes:

Speed Thresholds changed:
|          | Easy | Normal | Hard | Master |
|----------|------|--------|------|--------|
| Now      | 275  | 300    | 325  | 350    |
| Normally | 180  | 180    | 180  | 180    |

Being mid-air does no longer count as being fast.

I do believe this might make things easier, so I want some feedback if you guys are willing to give it :D
## Installation Notes
*It's a normal Icepick mod, but you have to delete (or download the fixes for the campaign from the discord server) CustomGauntlets and IcepickFramework.*
